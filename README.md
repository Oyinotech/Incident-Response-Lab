# Cisco XDR Rapid Incident Response

## Objective

- Gain hands-on experience using Cisco XDR to detect, investigate, and respond to simulated Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs).
- Apply the SANS Incident Response framework (Identification, Containment, Eradication, Recovery) in a real-world lab environment.
- Strengthen ability to correlate threat intelligence data, analyze attack chains, and identify root causes.

### Tools Used

- Cisco XDR (Extended Detection & Response): threat detection, response, and incident correlation
- Threat Intelligence Feeds: correlation and enrichment of alerts
- Log & Event Data: forensics and root cause analysis


### Skills Learned

- Incident Detection & Analysis: validating alerts, identifying malicious activity, and confirming incidents.
- Threat Containment Strategies: isolating compromised systems to prevent lateral movement.
- Root Cause Analysis: investigating attack vectors, persistence mechanisms, and vulnerabilities exploited.
- Incident Eradication & Recovery: removing malicious artifacts, restoring systems, and validating environment security.
- Threat Hunting: correlating suspicious activities across multiple data sources to uncover hidden threats.


## Outcome
Successfully simulated a full incident response cycle against an APT scenario using Cisco XDR, reinforcing the ability to detect, investigate, contain, eradicate, and recover from cyber threats in a structured and repeatable manner.
